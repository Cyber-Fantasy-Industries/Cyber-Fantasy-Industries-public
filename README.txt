basic notes for now

every week a campaign, that goes for 2 weeks (?)
every campaign ist for every specific phase (enter link)

this is to generate media attention and fill the sozial networks (enter link)
the campaign sets its "least to generate funding" for the very phase (enter link)

is the required funding generated this is called "in budget"
"over buget" is when more funding was generated than required
everything "over buget" goes into the "over buget bucket" (enter link here)
has the required funding not been generated its called "under buget"
the rest (if possible) will be paid from the "over buget bucket" in order to keep things going.


the fundings withing the "over buget bucket" will be allocated to other projects (enter link)

finances are all publicly available in order to generate trust. no exeptions.

investors can invest into all campains. their investments are accomulated accros campains in order to reach the reward-milestones (enter link here)
